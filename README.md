# Generative-AI-Prompt-Engineering-Basics
In this part of the course, I gained a deeper understanding of prompts and prompt engineering—a foundational skill in working effectively with generative AI models. I learned how prompts shape model outputs and how prompt engineering allows us to guide AI creativity in a structured, purposeful way.I explored the core components of an effective prompt: instruction, context, input data, and output indicators. I also discovered how refining prompts through iteration can improve clarity, precision, and relevance—essential for aligning AI responses with real-world needs.
I also developed a deeper understanding of advanced prompt engineering techniques that enhance the reliability, relevance, and depth of outputs from large language models (LLMs). I explored multiple strategies and frameworks that guide AI to generate more intelligent, contextual, and user-aligned responses. I learned how zero-shot and few-shot prompting help LLMs perform tasks with little or no prior examples. I also applied structured techniques like the Interview Pattern, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thought, all of which are designed to enhance reasoning and encourage more thoughtful and iterative outputs from AI systems.
The following screenshorts shows the practice hands-on lab projects that I did on this course.
